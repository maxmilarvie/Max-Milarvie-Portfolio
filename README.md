# Max-Milarvie-Portfolio
There are various documents in this portfolio, including some from my time at The University of Edinburgh in Scotland and some during my time at Boise State University in the USA. The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate some of the work I submitted and have put significant time into during my education.
